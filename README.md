# Using the Nitrous console

## Opening Nitrous

Nitrous is the cloud-based development environment you'll be using to write code on Learn. It's really easy to open Nitrous from a lesson on Learn: just click the Open button on the toolbar at the top of a lab. The Nitrous development environment will load in its own browser tab, making it easy for you to flip back and forther between Learn and your code. Note: since this lesson is simply a README, e.g. does not have any code associated with it, you're not able to open it in Nitrous.

It's worth pausing for a moment to reflect on how Nitrous works. When you signed up for Learn, we created a Nitrous "instance" for you, also known as a "container". You can think of this container as a virtual computer in the cloud (running on a server somewhere on the Internet), which you access in a web browser through the Nitrous interface, that gives you access to all of the things you'd expect from a real computer: the ability to browse files, create documents and interact with the shell. Conveniently, that's all you need to develop software. 

Let's spend a minute studying the Nitrous user interface. You'll notice that it's composed of three sections: (1) a file browser (2) a text editor and (3) the console. 

## Nitrous file browser

The left side of your Nitrous window houses a simple file browser. It works just like a file browser on any computer: you can navigate a tree of folders and files to find the file you're looking for. Opening a file will open its contents in the text editor on the right.

## Nitrous text editor

The text editor is the heart of the Nitrous IDE (integrated development environment). It's where you'll write code, and thus where you'll be spending most of your time. One of the nifty things about text editors that have been optimized for programming, like Nitrous, is that your code will highlight as you type in ways that make it easier to discern the structure of your program. You'll notice this when you start writing your own code.  

## Nitrous console

While the upper part of the screen is where you write code, the lower part of the screen is called the console, giving you access to the shell. This is where you'll be typing in commands to control your container. If you were using a Mac OSX environment, this command line is referred to as the "Terminal"â€”so if you ever hear people mention Terminal, this console is your equivalent in Nitrous. 

We'll soon cover how to enter commands into the console that will allow you open, test and submit code.
